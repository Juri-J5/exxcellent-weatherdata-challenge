/**
 * This package contains all classes, that are used to select a specific row from a table given as an {@link java.util.ArrayList} of String arrays.
 * All classes within this package must implement the {@link de.exxcellent.challenge.actions.rowSelectors.RowSelector} interface.
 *
 * Currently, only the selection of the row with the lowest discrepancy between two specified columns is supported.
