#  Weatherdata Challenge (provided by exxcellent solutions)

My personal attempt at the excellent programming challenge on weather data. This project deliberately does not include a license as I do not wish for further use of any infomation or code provided within this repository except for the exxcellent solutions GmbH to assess my coding capabilities.
This decision a precaution, because I have limited knoweledge of licenses and wish to avoid any potential violation.
