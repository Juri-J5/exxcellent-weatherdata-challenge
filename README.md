This project deliberately does not contain a license as I do not wish for further use of any infomation or code provided within this repository except for the exxcellent solutions GmbH to assess my coding capabilities.
This decision a precaution, because I have admittedly limited knoweledge of licenses and wish to avoid any potential violation.

The following files are exact copies from the source:
